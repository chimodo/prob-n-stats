    ### üîç Types of Samples

    ---

    ### üîπ Random sample
    - A sample of a predetermined size is chosen from the population.
    - Care is taken to choose the sample in such a way that **every sample of that size is equally likely to be selected**.
    - For example, a random sample can be chosen like this:  
    First, each member of the population is assigned a different number.  
    Then, a predetermined number of these assigned numbers is drawn at random using a computer program or a random number table.  
    The members assigned to the numbers drawn are selected for the sample.
    - A random sample with this description is also called a **simple random sample**.

    ---

    ### üîπ Systematic sample
    - The members of the population are listed in some order.
    - Then, **every k·µó ∞ member** (such as every 4·µó ∞ member) is selected for the sample until a predetermined sample size is reached.
    - *(The number k is usually chosen to be greater than 1 and small enough so that the predetermined sample size can be reached before the end of the list.)*

    ---

    ### üîπ Stratified sample
    - The population is divided into groups, with each group made up of members that share some particular characteristic(s), such as an occupation.
    - Then, a **fixed number of members** (but not all members) **from each group are randomly selected** for the sample.

    ---

    ### üîπ Cluster sample
    - The population is divided into groups that tend to exist naturally, such as cities in a state.
    - Then, **all members of some randomly chosen groups** (but not all groups) are selected for the sample.

    ---

    ### üîπ Convenience sample
    - Members of a population that are **easily accessible** are selected for the sample.
    - No consideration is made for selecting randomly at any point during the selection process.

### üîó Online Calculator Resources

When dealing with grouped data problems (mean, median, mode, frequency tables, histograms), you can quickly use these calculators:

- üëâ [Frequency Distribution Calculator (Mean, Median, Mode)](https://www.socscistatistics.com/descriptive/frequencydistribution/default.aspx)
    The calculator will also spit out a number of other descriptors of your data - mean, median, skewness, and so on.
- üëâ [Online Mean, Median, and Mode Calculator From a Frequency Table](https://stats.libretexts.org/Learning_Objects/02%3A_Interactive_Statistics/05%3A_Online_Mean_Median_and_Mode_Calculator_From_a_Frequency_Table)
    Enter the lower bounds, the upper bounds, and the frequencies for each of the intervals of the frequency table and then hit Calculate.
- üëâ [Sample Variance, Standard deviation and coefficient of variation calculator for grouped data](https://atozmath.com/StatsG.aspx?q=4)

Frequency distribution problems: youll either be given class intervals, or a dataset with number of classes

Given number of classes, use this calculator:
- üëâ [Grouped Frequency Distribution Calculator](https://goodcalculators.com/grouped-frequency-distribution-calculator/)
Note that this is frequency, NOT cumulative frequency

### üß† Important Notes
- An ogive **starts at 0** cumulative frequency.
- It is **always rising** (never decreases).
- Useful for finding medians, quartiles, percentiles.

### üîç How to Tell Skewness Quickly

---

Skewness as per Karl Pearson's Measure
**Skewness = Mean - Mode**

![Skewdness examples](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20231101173636/Skewness-copy.webp)

### ‚û°Ô∏è Positively Skewed (Right-Skewed)
- Tail **stretches to the right** (toward larger numbers).
- Most data is **bunched on the left**, few larger outliers pull the mean to the right.
- **Mean > Median > Mode**.

**üîé Look for:**
- Short bars on the right side.
- A few very large values.



---

### ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Negatively Skewed (Left-Skewed)
- Tail **stretches to the left** (toward smaller numbers).
- Most data is **bunched on the right**, few smaller outliers pull the mean to the left.
- **Mean < Median < Mode**.

**üîé Look for:**
- Short bars on the left side.
- A few very small values.

---

### üü∞ Symmetric (Fairly Symmetric)
- Data is **evenly distributed** around the center.
- **Mean ‚âà Median**.
- No obvious tails.

**üîé Look for:**
- Balanced peak in the middle.

![Symmetric Distribution Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Normal_distribution_pdf.svg/320px-Normal_distribution_pdf.svg.png)

---

### üß† Super Fast Tip:
> - **Tail points = Skew points.**  
> (Tail goes right ‚Üí positive skew; tail goes left ‚Üí negative skew)

---

### ‚ö° Strategy
When unsure:
- Find where the **long tail** is ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs subtle.
- Remember, a few extreme values can cause **positive** or **negative** skew even if the rest looks "balanced."
